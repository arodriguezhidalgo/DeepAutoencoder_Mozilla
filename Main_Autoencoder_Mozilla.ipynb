    "The goal of this project consists of designing a model to generate audio features using Deep autoencoders. In order to do so, the [Mozilla Common Voice dataset](https://voice.mozilla.org/en) is used for training, since it has several recorded files whose quality is validated by users. We don't pay attention to any of the available labels, since performing speech recognition using weak labels is out of the scope of this work.\n",
