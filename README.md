# DeepClassifier_Audioset

Code originally proposed to implement train autoencoder structures for feature extraction using Mozilla Common Voice. This first approach tries to replicate the AuDeep model.
* An example is depicted in [Main_Autoencoder_Mozilla.ipynb](https://github.com/arodriguezhidalgo/DeepAutoencoder_Mozilla/blob/master/Main_Autoencoder_Mozilla.ipynb).
* New Deep models can be written into the file [Mozilla_models.py](https://github.com/arodriguezhidalgo/DeepAutoencoder_Mozilla/blob/master/Mozilla_models.py), which can be then called from the main notebook.

WARNING: This is a work in progress.

## Versioning
v1.0:
* First trainable implementation of the model.
